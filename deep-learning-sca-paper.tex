% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/

%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.

%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/

%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.

%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.

\section{Introduction}
Data encryption is commonly employed to restrict data access to selected people or endpoints. Proper encryption provides privacy, integrity and authenticity of data exchanged between two or more parties over an insecure connection. An encryption key or a pair of keys is generated with which the chosen data is encrypted, so that the data can only be read or modified by an endpoint who possesses the appropriate encryption key. For symmetric encryption, where the same secret key is used to encrypt and decrypt data, the key has to be shared over a secure connection beforehand, whereas asymmetric encryption uses key pairs, one of which is used to encrypt and one is used to decrypt data. Therefore, asymmetric encryption enables two parties to exchange data securely over an insecure connection by publishing the key used for encryption and keeping the key used for decryption private. This paper will only consider symmetric encryption, although techniques discussed could also partly be applied to asymmetric encryption algorithms.

\subsection{The Advanced Encryption Standard}
While there are many encryption algorithms available, this paper focuses on the most popular symmetric block cipher: the Advanced Encryption Standard (henceforth AES) with a \SI{128}{\bit} key. The AES algorithm encrypts data in blocks of \SI{128}{\bit} or \SI{16}{\byte}. Should a block be smaller than \SI{16}{\byte}, padding will be appended until the block size reaches \SI{16}{\byte}. Furthermore, AES expands a single \SI{128}{\bit} key to 11 round keys which are then used in the subseqent 11 rounds to encrypt the given data. It is important to note, that a compromise of any of the 11 round keys enables an attacker to reconstruct the initial \SI{128}{\bit} key and thus decrypt the whole encrypted data set. 

\subsection{Side Channel Analysis}
Side Channel Analysis (henceforth SCA) refers to a technique used to break encryption schemes by using data indirectly generated by the implementation of the cryptographic algorithm, instead of attacking the algorithm itself. Even a theoretically perfectly safe cryptographic algorithm can be subject to SCA and be broken by it. SCA uses side channels such as the power consumption of an microprocessor, electro magnetic emissions or even emitted sound to reconstruct the entire or parts of the secret key used to encrypt the data. It can be possible to infer the secret key form side channel data due to data dependant program flows. That means, that the code contains conditional statements acting on the secret key data. For example a certain loop will only execute if the currently procressed key bit is zero, therefore the power consumption of the microprocessor will measurably increase. Furthermore, power modelling is used to predict an microprocessor's power consumption based on the secret key data. Power models such as Hamming Weight (a "1" consumes more energy to be processed than a "0") or Hamming Distance (bitwise comparison resulting in the number of different bits) are popular choices ... Therefore, to protect against SCA it is vital to pay attention not only on the theoretical safety of an encryption algorithm but also on its implementation.

\subsubsection{Defenses against Side Channel Attacks - should it be included???}

\section{State of the Art}
State of the art of crypto attacks

\subsection{The state of Side Channel Analysis}
Side channel attacks were first developed in 1996 by Paul Kocher \cite{first-sca:kocher} in the form of timing attacks. Timing attacks exploit an implementation's execution flow dependence on secret key data, which results in a different execution time if a key bit is for example 0 rather than 1. Later, SCAs have been extended to infer a secret key by analysing a processor's power consumption and its dependence on secret key data. 

\subsubsection{Simple Power Analysis}
Simple Power Analysis (henceforth SPA) is a SCA based on the power consumption of the target device. The target device (e.g. a smart card) performs multiple encryption or decryption operations during which the attacker measures the device's power consumption. The attacker does not know the plaintext, which makes it a ciphertext only attack (COA). Then, the attacker calculates a hypothetical power consumption for each possible key combination using for example the Hamming Weight model. Finally, he correlates the hypothetical power consumption to the measured power traces and then ranks the hypothetical keys accordingly. The correct key should now be among the top ranked hypothetical keys. However, SPA is very reliant on clean power traces. Modern computers perform many operations in parallel and thus generate a lot of noise, which is why SPA is only used on simple devices like smart cards. 

\subsubsection{Differential Power Analysis}
Differential Power Analysis (henceforth DPA) is similar to SPA because it also tries to extract the secret key from a device by using power traces taken during a operation. However, in contrast to the SPA, multiple power traces are taken during different device states. Power traces of the target device are also taken while the device is idle to determine the background noise. The noise level is then subtracted from the power traces taken during the cryptographic operation, resulting in a more distinct signal. Still, concurrent operations running parallel to the cryptographic operations worsen the quality of the power traces, but that can be averaged out if enough traces are taken. Thus, DPA can also be used on more complex devices than smart cards.

\subsubsection{High-order Differential Power Analysis}
High-order Differential Power Analysis (henceforth HO-DPA) is similar to DPA but additionally, further power traces are taken at multiple steps of the cryptographic operation. HO-DPA allows to attack implementations using masking to hide cryptographic operations, by taking power traces at the mask generation, thereby demasking the final encryption operation. However, due to taking many different traces and correlating them with one another, HO-DPAs are highly complex and not used when a DPA or a SPA could also viably attack an implementation.

\subsubsection{Template Attacks}
\label{subsec:template}
A Template Attack is a very targeted attack on an implementation of a cryptographic algorithm. The premise is, that the attacker only has restricted access to the target machine, but ubiquitous access to similar machines containing a varying secret key. The attacker can now execute encryption operations while varying the secret key and measuring the machine's power consumption. The goal is to acquire a large labeled data set, mapping power consumption to secret key of this specific machine. Afterwards, the attacker trains a machine learning model, such as a Support Vectore Machine (SVM) with the model to be able to determine the secret key by using the power consumption. In the end, the attacker obtains one or two powertraces of the target machine during an encryption or decryption operation and feeds the powertrace into the SVM for analysis. The SVM will now output a potential secret key.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.

% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
